### Build

## 1.0.0

Released on 2026-09-15

### Breaking changes

- feat: add blocking client behind tokio feature

Add AwsS3Fs::into_blocking and BlockingAwsS3Fs, mirroring the pattern
used in remotefs-webdav, so callers can get a RemoteFs implementation
without wiring remotefs::adapters::blocking::BlockOn themselves.

- build: pin aws-smithy-types below the breaking 1.7.0 release

aws-smithy-types 1.7.0 changed the Document::Object variant's inner
type without a major version bump, which breaks compilation of
aws-smithy-json 0.63.0 (pulled in transitively via aws-config) once
cargo unifies the whole tree to smithy-types 1.7.0. Constrain the
dependency until the ecosystem catches up.

- docs: gate the tokio feature correctly for docs.rs

The blocking client lives behind the non-default tokio feature, so
docs.rs never rendered it. Build docs.rs with that feature enabled
and mark the gated items with doc(cfg(...)) so the rendered docs show
the feature requirement.

- fix: switch MinIO test image to quay.io and watch its stderr banner

instead, pinned to a current release. That image also moved its
